- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ScienceJoshua
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in communications network application development
      as well as mobile application development,biometric hardware development,
   and software Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying to become a Software Engineer.

I am interested to learn as much as possible about low level programming including 64 bit assembly and additional recent advancements in computer programming,software development and hardware engineering of computer processors and graphical processors as to the computer science elements that relates to the production of both computer processors and graphical processors. 

I am likely to enter a Masters pathway of study 
in the year 2025 that especially completes research into questions like " What are the shared structures of computer processor logical instructions that all of the latest computer processors and graphical processor units share and what specific instructions and features vary from manufacturer to manufacturer? What specific technology makes one processor more favorable for specific tasks? What instruction sets add the most value and what are the fundamental differences between RISC and CISC models and other models? 
 I am interested to learn more about interprocess messaging services.


+Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile application development projects like Swift or others after completing academic items in progress
+ apps that are related to physical fitness, or project management, and include
+ Machine Learning.
